# Word-iverse

This is an experiment to play with Elixir, OTP, and _(eventually)_ neural networks implemented in Elixir.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Build out a WordFued/Scabble like game in Elixir, via OTP
- [ ] Build a dictionary and rule set to secure the game
- [ ] Build a basic "look ahead" player bot
- [ ] Build a neural network player bot and train
